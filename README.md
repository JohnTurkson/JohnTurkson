I'm a 3rd year CS student currently studying at The University of British Columbia.

## Stuff that I'm currently working on
- Building serverless APIs with AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda
- Implemented a Sigv4 signer from scratch in order to talk to AWS APIs in kotlin
- Wrote an x-amz-json to application/json converter to seamlessly convert between data classes in kotlin and documents in DynamoDB
- (Slowly) building my own [AWS SDK](https://github.com/JohnTurkson/aws-tools) in order to better integrate with Kotlin's native language features
- Playing around with Jetpack Compose (Android + Desktop), Kotlin Multiplatform, and automation with Jetbrains Space

## Stuff that I've done in the past
- Worked as an Android Developer (Co-op) at Later (and picked up some Android fundamentals along the way)
- Went to a hackathon (NWHacks 2020) and built the backend of an entire app in under 24 hours (currently being rewritten [here](https://github.com/JohnTurkson/tripwatch))
- Implemented a websocket server according to the RFC 6455 spec (<websocket-server>)
- [Built a DSL in Kotlin]("https://github.com/JohnTurkson/readable-regular-expressions")
- Wrote too many overcomplicated build.gradle.kts scripts
